# 🚀 Why is Turbopack Faster than Webpack?

Turbopack is the next-gen bundler created by **Vercel** (the team behind Next.js) to replace Webpack. It’s optimized for speed, modern web features, and developer experience.

---

## 🧠 What Do Bundlers Like Webpack and Turbopack Do?

- Analyze and bundle JS, CSS, images, etc.
- Watch for file changes during development
- Serve your app efficiently in the browser

---

## ⚡ Key Reasons Turbopack is Faster

### 1. 🦀 Written in Rust (Not JavaScript)
- Rust is a compiled, low-level systems language that's **much faster** than JavaScript.
- Webpack is JS-based and slower for large builds.
- Rust = Racecar, JS = Scooter 🚗💨

---

### 2. 🧩 Incremental Bundling
- Only **rebuilds changed files**, not the whole app.
- Super fast hot-reloads (1ms–100ms vs 500ms+ in Webpack).

---

### 3. 📁 On-Demand Compilation
- Turbopack compiles **only the routes/files requested** by the browser.
- Doesn't waste time compiling unused parts of the app.

> Like a chef cooking just your order, not the whole menu.

---

### 4. 🌐 Optimized for Modern Features
- Built with support for:
  - React Server Components (RSC)
  - Code Splitting
  - Streaming

> Webpack supports these, but they weren’t designed into it from the start.

---

### 5. 🧠 Persistent Caching
- Remembers previous builds and only rebuilds changed code.
- Follow-up builds are **almost instant**.
