This is a full-featured **real-time chat application** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express.js**, and **Redis**. It supports real-time messaging via **Socket.IO**, secure authentication with **NextAuth**, and PostgreSQL integration using **Prisma ORM**. The UI is designed with **Tailwind CSS**, **Radix UI**, and supports dark/light themes using `next-themes`.

The app was built solo and is structured for scalability and future extensibility, including a planned integration with **Kafka** for message streaming.

## Features

- **Full-Stack Real-Time Chat**: Seamless real-time communication using Socket.IO with Redis pub/sub for fast and scalable messaging.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented using NextAuth with JWT strategy and secure password hashing via `bcrypt`.
- **Modern UI**: Built using Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, and supports dark/light theming.
- **Type-Safe Codebase**: Written entirely in TypeScript across frontend and backend.
- **Form Validation**: Uses Zod with React Hook Form for reliable user input validation.
- **Planned Kafka Integration**: Though currently paused due to Upstash limitations, the architecture is prepared for Kafka adoption in future releases.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: Used for frontend routing, server-side rendering, and app structure.
- **React + TypeScript**: Component-driven architecture with strict typing and form handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling.
- **Radix UI & Lucide Icons**: For accessible, modern UI components and icons.
- **NextAuth**: Secure, extendable authentication system using JWT.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight backend API layer written in TypeScript.
- **Prisma ORM**: Connects to PostgreSQL for type-safe database access.
- **Redis**: Used with Socket.IO for reliable real-time communication.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time bidirectional messaging.
- **Zod + React Hook Form**: For client-side and server-side form validation.
