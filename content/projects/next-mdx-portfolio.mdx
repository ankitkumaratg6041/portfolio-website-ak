This is a modern, fully responsive **developer portfolio website** built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**. It features a dark/light theme toggle, showcases blog posts and projects, and includes a contact form for direct communication. The site is deployed via Vercel and continuously integrated with GitHub for instant updates on push.

## Features

- **Dark & Light Theme**: Users can toggle between themes using the `next-themes` plugin.

- **Recent Projects**: Displays the most recent projects with hover effects and links to live demos when available.
- **Social Footer**: Clean footer with social media links.
- **MDX Blog System**: All articles and project reports are written in `.mdx`, allowing for rich formatting and easy publishing.
