**City Simulation** is a modular 3D rendering project built using OpenGL and C++. It simulates an interactive urban environment where users control a vehicle, observe dynamic traffic systems, and switch between real-time camera perspectives. The project emphasizes a clean rendering pipeline and optimized object modeling using modern OpenGL concepts.

## Architecture Overview

The application is organized into multiple object-oriented classes to maximize separation of concerns and scalability:

- **`Car` Class**: Encapsulates vehicle geometry, transformation logic, and animation (e.g., tire rotation, reverse lighting). Movement is handled through `glTranslatef` and `glRotatef` chained with bounding box collision checks.
- **`Cuboid` Class**: Represents city buildings, each with programmatically generated windows. Rendered using custom vertex arrays for face construction and dynamic color assignment.
- **`TrafficLight` Class**: Manages independent traffic lights using internal timers for state cycling (red, yellow, green).
- **`BoundingBox` Class**: Handles axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) calculations for car-to-object collision detection.
- **Camera System**: Built with `gluLookAt` for four perspectives (F1‚ÄìF4) with dynamic updates based on car orientation and position.

## Rendering Techniques

- **Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs)** and **Vertex Array Objects (VAOs)** are used to streamline draw calls and minimize CPU-GPU overhead.
- **Programmable Pipeline**: Basic GLSL shaders support flexible lighting and object coloring.
- **Hierarchical Transformations**: Wheels, lights, and windows are child objects transformed relative to the car‚Äôs local coordinate system.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: WASD/Arrow keys enable real-time car movement, including turning and reversing.
- **Multiple Camera Modes**: `gluLookAt` enables smooth view switching between third-person, top-down, corner, and first-person views.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Buildings vary in size and shape with auto-scaled windows. Traffic lights cycle independently.
- **Collision Detection**: Car movement is restricted on intersecting bounding boxes of buildings.
- **Memory Debugging**: **Valgrind** was used extensively to detect leaks and invalid accesses in heap-allocated objects and vectors.
- **Build System**: Includes a Makefile for easy compilation with dependency flags for `GL`, `GLEW`, and `GLUT`.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites (Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
```

## Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
make main
./main
```

## Controls
- Drive: W / S or ‚Üë / ‚Üì ‚Äî Forward / Backward
- Steering: A / D or ‚Üê / ‚Üí ‚Äî Left / Right (only when moving)
- Views: F1 to F4 ‚Äî Behind car, overhead, top-corner, driver view
- Exit: ESC

## Limitations
- **Bounding Box Precision**: Randomized building geometry can misalign bounding boxes, leading to occasional pass-throughs.
- **Static Layout**: Buildings and roads are statically positioned; procedural generation could enhance scalability.
- **Window Artifacts**: Edge-case building shapes can cause skewed or misaligned window placements.

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time shadows and lighting via Phong or Blinn shaders.
- Refactor collision detection to support mesh-level resolution.
- Enable interactive traffic systems (e.g., responsive lights).
- Procedural generation of city layout from seed values or user input.

## Reflection
This project solidified my understanding of transformation hierarchies, OpenGL buffer management, and real-time interaction in graphics applications. It was a hands-on deep dive into 3D engine fundamentals, and despite existing limitations, the result is a strong baseline for further graphics-intensive simulations or game-like environments.
